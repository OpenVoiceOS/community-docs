# Bluetooth speaker

The buildroot edition of OpenVoiceOS by default also acts as a bluetooth speaker. You can find it from any (mobile) device as discoverable within the bluetooth pairing menu.

You can pair with it and use your OpenVoiceOS as any other Bluetooth speaker you might own.
(NOTE: At the moment, pairing is broken but will be fixed as soon as we get to it)
