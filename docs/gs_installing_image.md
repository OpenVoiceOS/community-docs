## Flashing your image

Flashing your image to your sdcard or USB drive is not different from flashing any other image. For the non-technical users we advise to use the flashing utility from the Raspberry Pi Foundation which you can find [here](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/).
Under "CHOOSE OS" select custom at the very bottom of the list and browse to the downloaded image file. It is not required to unzip / unpack the image as the Raspberry Pi imager software can do that for you on the fly.
Under "CHOOSE STORAGE" select your sdcard or USB device.

If you have a Raspberry Pi 4 we recommend to use a good USB3.1 device. If you have a Raspberry Pi 3, use a proper sdcard. (From fast to slow: USB3.1 - sdcard - USB2)
