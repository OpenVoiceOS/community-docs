# APIs

There are several API's used by OVOS including for weather inquiries, Wolfram-alpha and others

OVOS provides default keys that are used by default and no more configuration is needed.

You can always provide your own API keys for each service, and even add more APIs for OVOS to use.

**TODO** fix link to api config
