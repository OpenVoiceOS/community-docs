# Playing video

Although the screen used on your OpenVoiceOS device might be small, the whole OCP mediaplaying frame does support video playback.

You can find video OCP skills in the same [awesome-ocp-skills](https://github.com/OpenVoiceOS/awesome-ocp-skills) list. The fourth column, "playback type" shows which type of payer is used for that specific skill.

If you use a skill that utilizes the "video player" the below will be shown on your OpenVoiceOS it's screen at playback.
