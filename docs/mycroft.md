NOTES:

- [HiveMind Voice Satellite](https://github.com/JarbasHiveMind/HiveMind-voice-sat) uses ovos-core and supports the same
  features
- Pyaudio has a bug in python 3.10, you may need to use [this fork](https://git.skeh.site/skeh/pyaudio) (ovos-core and
  mk2 only)
- VAD is supported in mycroft mark2 branch, but is hardcoded for silero
- Sleep mode loop has been [rewritten in ovos-core](https://github.com/OpenVoiceOS/ovos-core/pull/10) and is much more
  responsive than mycroft
- [Mic handling logic](https://github.com/OpenVoiceOS/ovos-core/pull/82) has been ported from mk2 branch and is much
  more responsive than mycroft dev branch
- Instant / Hybrid / Continuous listen settings are experimental, good microphone and AEC are highly recommended (such
  as a mark2)
- in ovos-core this functionality has
  been [refactored and moved](https://github.com/OpenVoiceOS/ovos-core/tree/dev/mycroft/listener) to the
  new `mycroft.listener`module

- OCP can control MPRIS enabled players, e.g. spotify

NOTES:

- [HiveMind](https://github.com/JarbasHiveMind) is being developed against ovos-core, development under mycroft-core is
  stalled, see the [hivemind wiki](https://github.com/JarbasHiveMind/HiveMind-core/wiki/Mycroft-Messages) for details
- XDG support includes multiple skill directories, all skill data, all configuration files, and all cached files
- You can build your own assistant on top of ovos-core, multiple assistants
  can [co-exist in the same machine and use their own configuration files](https://github.com/OpenVoiceOS/ovos-config/blob/dev/ovos_config/meta.py)
  , ovos-core is packaged like a regular python package and can be handled as a requirement by package managers
    - examples projects: [neon-core](https://github.com/NeonGeckoCom/NeonCore/)
