# OVOS Skills

## What can a Skill do?

Skills give OVOS the ability to perform a variety of functions. They can be installed or removed by the user, and can be
easily updated to expand functionality. To get a good idea of what skills to build, let’s talk about the best use cases
for a voice assistant, and what types of things OVOS can do.

OVOS can run on a variety of platforms from the Linux Desktop to SBCs like the raspberry pi.
Different devices will have slightly different use cases. Devices in the home are generally located in the living room
or kitchen and are ideal for listening to the news, playing music, general information, using timers while cooking,
checking the weather, and other similar activities that are easily accomplished hands free.

### Basic functions

We cover a lot of the basics with our Default Skills, things like Timers, Alarms, Weather, Time and Date, and more.

### Information

We also call this General Question and Answer, and it covers all of those factual questions someone might think to ask a
voice assistant. Questions like “who was the 32nd President of the United States?”, or “how tall is Eiffel Tower?”
Although the Default Skills cover a great deal of questions there is room for more. There are many topics that could use
a specific skill such as Science, Academics, Movie Info, TV info, and Music info, etc..

### Media

One of the biggest use cases for Smart Speakers is playing media. The reason media playback is so popular is because it
makes playing a song so easy, all you have to do is say “Hey Mycroft play the Beatles,” and you can be enjoying music
without having to reach for a phone or remote. In addition to listening to music, there are
skills that handle videos as well.

### News

Much like listening to music, getting the latest news with a simple voice interaction is extremely convenient. OVOS
supports multiple news feeds, and has the ability to support multiple news skills.

### Smart Home

Another popular use case for Voice Assistants is to control Smart Home and IoT products. Within the mycroft ecosystem
there
are skills for Home Assistant, Wink IoT, Lifx and more, but there are many products that we do not have skill for yet.
The open source community has been enthusiastically expanding OVOS's ability to voice control all kinds of smart home
products.

### Games

Voice games are becoming more and more popular, especially those that allow multiple users to play together. Trivia
games are some of the most popular types of games to develop for voice assistants. There are several games already
available for OVOS. There are native voice adventure games, ports of the popular text adventure games from infocom, a
Crystal Ball game, a Number Guessing game and much more!
