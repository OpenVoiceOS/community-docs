# OVOS Listener
The listener is responsible for loading STT, VAD and Wake Word plugins

Speech is transcribed into text and forwarded to the skills service.

The newest listener that OVOS uses is [ovos-dinkum-listener](https://github.com/OpenVoiceOS/ovos-dinkum-listener).  It is a version of the listener from the Mycroft Dinkum software for the Mark 2 modified for use with OVOS.
