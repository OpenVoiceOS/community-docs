# Skill Settings

Skill settings provide the ability for users to configure a Skill using the command line or a web-based interface. 

This is often used to:

* Change default behaviors - such as the sound used for users alarms.
* Authenticate with external services - such as Spotify
* Enter longer data as text rather than by voice - such as the IP address of the users Home Assistant server.

Skill settings are completely optional.
