# PHAL

[PHAL](https://github.com/OpenVoiceOS/ovos_PHAL) is our Platform/Hardware Abstraction Layer, it completely replaces the
concept of hardcoded "enclosure" from mycroft-core

Any number of plugins providing functionality can be loaded and validated at runtime, plugins can
be [system integrations](https://github.com/OpenVoiceOS/ovos-PHAL-plugin-system) to handle things like reboot and
shutdown, or hardware drivers such as [mycroft mark2 plugin](https://github.com/OpenVoiceOS/ovos-PHAL-plugin-mk2)

PHAL plugins can perform actions such as hardware detection before loading, eg, the mark2 plugin will not load if it
does not detect the sj201 hat. This makes plugins safe to install and bundle by default in our base images


## Plugins

Platform/Hardware specific integrations are loaded by PHAL, these plugins can handle all sorts of system activities

## Developers

In mycroft-core the equivalent to PHAL plugins would usually be shipped as skills or hardcoded

in OVOS sometimes it may be unclear if we should develop a skill or plugin, there isn't a one size fits all answer, in some circumstances it may make sense to create both a plugin and a companion skill

### Template 

PHAL plugins do not follow a strict template, they are usually event listeners that perform certain actions and integrate with other components


```python
from mycroft_bus_client import Message
from ovos_plugin_manager.phal import PHALPlugin


class MyPHALPluginValidator:
    @staticmethod
    def validate(config=None):
        """ this method is called before loading the plugin.
        If it returns False the plugin is not loaded.
        This allows a plugin to run platform checks"""
        return True


class MyPHALPlugin(PHALPlugin):
    validator = MyPHALPluginValidator

    def __init__(self, bus=None, config=None):
        super().__init__(bus=bus, name="ovos-PHAL-plugin-NAME", config=config)
        # register events for plugin
        self.bus.on("my.event", self.handle_event)

    def handle_event(self, message):
        # TODO plugin stuff
        self.bus.emit(Message("my.event.response"))

    def shutdown(self):
        # cleanly remove any event listeners and perform shutdown actions
        self.bus.remove("my.event", self.handle_event)
        super().shutdown()
```

## Admin PHAL

AdminPHAL performs the exact same function as PHAL, but plugins it loads will have `root` privileges. 

This service is intended for handling any OS-level interactions requiring escalation of privileges. Be very careful when installing Admin plugins and scrutinize them closely

NOTE: Because this service runs as root, plugins it loads are responsible for not writing
configuration changes which would result in breaking config file permissions.

### Service

to use AdminPHAL create a launcher `/usr/libexec/mycroft-systemd-admin-phal`

```python
import sdnotify
from ovos_PHAL.admin import main

n = sdnotify.SystemdNotifier()

def notify_ready():
    n.notify('READY=1')
    print('Startup of Admin service complete')

def notify_stopping():
    n.notify('STOPPING=1')
    print('Stopping Admin service')

main(ready_hook=notify_ready, stopping_hook=notify_stopping)
```

and system service `/usr/lib/systemd/user/mycroft-admin-phal.service`

```
[Unit]
Description=Admin PHAL
PartOf=mycroft.service
After=mycroft-messagebus.service

[Service]
Type=notify
TimeoutStopSec=30
Restart=always
User=root
ExecStart=/usr/libexec/mycroft-systemd-admin-phal

[Install]
WantedBy=mycroft.service
```

### Plugins

AdminPlugins are just like regular PHAL plugins that run with `root` privileges

A plugin needs to identify itself as an admin plugin via it's entry point, PHAL will not load Admin plugins and AdminPHAL will not load regular plugins

Admin plugins will only load if their configuration contains `"enabled": true`. All admin plugins need to be explicitly enabled
