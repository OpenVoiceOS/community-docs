# Welcome To OpenVoiceOS

## Where to get OVOS?
OVOS is in early stages, we publish our Raspberry Pi images for download but expect new bugs and new fixes on every release, we are not yet stable!

These images are development images in alpha stage, bugs and incomplete features are guaranteed.

## Installation choices
You can install OVOS either as an image, container, or manually.

There are currently two image choices for OVOS.  Buildroot, and Raspbian.  You can also build images from scratch for both options.  (Details in the works)

Docker containers are avaliable Windows, Macs, and Linux

In most cases images provide for the easiest install if your hardware is supported.  Check the [Quick Start Guide](quick_start.md) for help getting runnin quickly.

Building your own image can provide for a complete custom build in a package, but is more of an involved process.  If you're familiar with Docker, then that option can provide a quick install.

Guides on building images is located in our [technical docs](#)
