# OVOS Friends

OpenVoiceOS is part of a larger ecosystem of FOSS voice technology, we work closely with the following projects

Plasma Bigscreen integrates and uses OpenVoiceOS as voice framework stack to serve voice queries and voice
applications (skills with a homescreen), one can easily enable mycroft / ovos integration in the bigscreen launcher by
installing ovos core and required services and enabling the integration switch in the bigscreen KCM

Neon was one the first projects ever to adopt ovos-core as a library to build their own voice assistant, 
Neon works closely together with OVOS and both projects are mostly intercompatible

Mycroft AI started it all, it was one of the first ever FOSS voice assistants and is the project OVOS descends from. 

Most applications made for mycroft will work in OVOS and vice-versa

Secret Sauce AI is a coordinated community of tech minded AI enthusiasts working together on projects to identify
blockers and improve the basic open source tools and pipeline components in the AI (voice) assistant pipeline (wakeword,
ASR, NLU, NLG, TTS). The focus is mostly geared toward deployment on edge devices and self hosted solutions. This is not
a voice assistant project in and of itself, rather Secret Sauce AI helps AI (voice) assistant projects come together as
individuals and solve basic problems faced by the entire community.
