But wait, there's more!!

OVOS ships with a default TTS (Text to Speech) engine which speaks in the origional `Alan-Pope` voice that Mycroft used.  There are MANY more to choose from.  The following link will help you choose and configure a different voice for your assistant.

Your OVOS assistant uses a "wake word" which lets it know it is time to start listening to your commands.  By default, the phrase to wake OVOS is `Hey Mycroft`.  This, like most things in OVOS is totally configurable.  Follow the link to learn more.

- [Changing the Wake Word](#) **WIP**

OVOS ships with default services avaliabe to the public to use.  These include public TTS and STT servers, a weather API provided by [link to weather provider](#), access to Wolfram, and more.  Part of being an open and private system, you can also change these to your own prefrences.
