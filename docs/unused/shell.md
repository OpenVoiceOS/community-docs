### Shell Options
`~/.config/OpenvoiceOS/OvosShell.conf` can be edited to change shell options that
may also be changed via UI. An example config would look like:
```
[General]
fakeBrightness=1
menuLabels=true
```

### Themes
Shell themes can be included in `/usr/share/OVOS/ColorSchemes/` or 
`~/.local/share/OVOS/ColorSchemes/` in json format. Note that colors should include
an alpha value (usually `FF`).

```json
{
  "name": "Neon Green",
  "primaryColor": "#FF072103",
  "secondaryColor": "#FF2C7909",
  "textColor": "#FFF1F1F1"
}
```
