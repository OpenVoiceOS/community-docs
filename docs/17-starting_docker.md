# Starting OVOS - docker

Take a look at the [dedicated OVOS container documentation](https://openvoiceos.github.io/ovos-docker/)

There you will find a very comprehensive guide to running [OVOS with docker](https://github.com/OpenVoiceOS/ovos-docker)

And the newest addition is an [installer script](https://github.com/OpenVoiceOS/ovos-installer) that will guide you through the docker installation.
