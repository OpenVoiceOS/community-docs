[OCP](https://github.com/OpenVoiceOS/ovos-ocp-audio-plugin) stands for OpenVoiceOS Common Play, it is a full fledged
media player

## Introduction 

OCP is a [OVOSAbstractApplication](https://github.com/OpenVoiceOS/OVOS-workshop/blob/dev/ovos_workshop/app.py#L47), this
means it is a standalone but native OVOS applicatiom with full voice integration

OCP differs from a typical mycroft-core audio service in several aspects:

- Can run standalone, only needs a bus connection
- OCP provides it's own intents as if it was a skill
- OCP provides it's own GUI as if it was a skill
- mycroft-core CommonPlay skill framework is disabled when OCP loads
- OCP skills have a dedicated MycroftSkill subclass and decorators in ovos-workshop
- OCP skills act as media providers, they do not (usually) handle playback
- mycroft-core CommonPlay skills have an imperfect compatibility layer and are given lower priority over OCP skills
- OCP handles several kinds of playback, including video
- OCP has a sub-intent parser for matching requested media types
- AudioService becomes a subsystem for OCP
- OCP also has AudioService plugin component introducing a compatibility layer for skills using "old style audioservice
  api"
- OCP integrates with MPRIS, it can be controlled from external apps, eg KdeConnect in your phone
- OCP manages external MPRIS enabled players, you can voice control 3rd party apps without writing a skill for it via
  OCP

## OCP Skills

Skills provide search results, think about them as media providers/catalogs for OCP

You can find OCP skills in the [awesome-ocp-skills](https://github.com/OpenVoiceOS/awesome-ocp-skills) list 

## Configuration

OCP contains a audio service plugin component that acts as a compatibility layer with MycroftAI CommonPlay skills framework. 

in mycroft-core you can set OCP as `default-backend`, ovos-core is not required for OCP

For compatibility and historical reasons OCP reads it's configuration from the `"Audio"` section
