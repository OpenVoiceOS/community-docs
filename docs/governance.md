Open Voice Community Collaboration Cabal (OVC3) Not-A-Charter

Furnished by the Confederated Consortium of the Open Voice Community Collaboration Cabal,
for the benefit of its members, the Community Collaborator Cabal Community, Community Contributors to the
Community Collaborator Cabal's code, and Co.

Drafted May 04-07 2021

Fourth Draft

Adopted [date]

Real Legalese Not Available

Be it acknowledged:

1)  That this group (henceforth 'the Cabal', 'we', or 'us') originated as an informal association of programmers,
    familiar to one another as contributors to projects, both open source and commercial, which are part of,
    derive from, or implement the Mycroft personal voice assistant. Namely, with handles familiar to
    the aforementioned Mycroft project and associated communities:

    Aditya Mehra, KDE contributor, developer; makes things pretty, usually (handles: aix, AIIX)
    Daniel McKnight, NeonGecko developer; makes things go upstream, if they want (handles: NeonDaniel, daniel-neon)
    Casimiro Ferreira, omnipresent Mycroft implementer; makes things, sometimes incl. docs (handles: Jarbas, JarbasAl)
    Chance Rosenthal, indie dev; extends things, makes happen the talky explainage (handles: ChanceNCounter, chance)
    Peter Steenbergen, indie dev; makes things for things to run on so we can run things (handle: j1nx)

2)  That the Cabal arose organically, as an agreeable development team materialized around two major projects,
    being OpenVoiceOS, created by j1nx (henceforth 'OVOS', formerly 'MycroftOS') and HiveMind, created
    by Jarbas, both of which significantly predate the Cabal.

3)  That, although several of the Cabal's members are also members of organizations whose products implement
    or derive from Mycroft, the Cabal is not presently affiliated with or endorsed by any particular
    organization or group.

4)  That, the above notwithstanding, thanks and credit are due to Mycroft, BlueSystems and NeonGecko for making available
    to OpenVoiceOS a great deal of their own code, on permissive terms compatible with our licensing policy.

5)  That our licensing policy, as a matter of principle, and to facilitate the widespread and enthusiastic involvement
    of contributors whose licensing practices may differ from our own, shall be to license our open source works,
    whenever possible, under permissive licenses, placing no burdensome restrictions on how derivative works or
    implementations may utilize or redistribute our works. Examples of such licenses include, but are not necessarily
    limited to, the current (as of this writing) versions of the MIT, BSD, and Apache licenses.
    
    Specifications, documentation, and other literary works shall likewise be licensed as permissively as is practical.

    This should not be construed to mean that we will not cooperate with restrictively-licensed projects,
    though we must take pains to ensure our code is always license-compatible and compliant.

6)  That the Cabal reserves the right to replace itself with a formal, legally incorporated entity, should the
    need arise, or to replace this document with a more formal charter, should other organizations wish
    to become directly involved whose own policies require it.

7)  That the Cabal explicitly acknowledges its members' entitlement and, in some cases, desire, to:

      - Begin/continue to work on these or related projects in a professional capacity, or
      - Create a nonprofit foundation or business league to manage one or more of our projects, or
      - Create a company to market an implementation of one or more of our projects

    although the Cabal also notes that its founding members themselves, as of the date on this document, are not
    competing for the same business, but rather supporting each other's undertakings with an eye toward mutual success,
    whether our implementations are free or commercial, the future involvement or membership of competing, commercial
    implementations notwithstanding; and that, should the founders themselves attempt to poach each other's customers
    or business, such actions would be legal, but not very nice, considering the size of the market.

8)  When necessary, "BDFLs" for OVOS shall, for the foreseeable future, be j1nx and Jarbas, except that aix shall be responsible for all graphical elements and ovos-shell. A BDFL's authority shall be limited to the circumstances described in section (9).

9)  That the Cabal's governance shall consist of consensus-forming among its members, or, in the absence
    of a consensus, 
    
        (a) Noncontentious discussions shall be decided by the appropriate BDFL, except that any member
            may call for a vote.
        
        (b) Contentious discussions shall be decided by vote without exception.
        
        (c) In (and only in) the event of an emergency or an extremely time-sensitive problem, where an
            immediate, executive decision is required, the appropriate BDFL shall undertake the decision.

10) In the event that the Cabal's membership shrinks or grows to an even number, or a member recuses
    themselves or is absent from a vote, a tie may result. A trusted nonmember shall be designated at any given time
    whose sole responsibility with respect to the Cabal shall be to break any ties.

11) Members pledge to strive for consensus, and avoid situations in which the BDFL would need to invoke
    their rank in the first place, or where a vote is necessary.

12) The phrase "BDFL" is short for "Benevolent Dictator for Life," a term familiar to many in the fields of
    computer programming and software design, and is metaphorical. The Cabal's BDFLs, as described above, have
    extremely limited discretion in terms of unilateral decisionmaking.

13) Rules for "governance" shall not generally apply to routine tasks relating to infrastructure, repository
    management, or any other administrative duties, with respect to which a given member's permissions are a
    matter of understanding and common sense.

This document has not been shown to any attorneys because no attorney in their right mind would approve this document.
This document has not been signed because it probably isn't a legal document, and it would require travel to at least
four countries on at least two landmasses. Three, most of the time. The Cabal is not responsible for damages resulting
from the use or misuse of HiveMind, including, but not limited to, the formation of an artificial
intelligence bent on destruction, whether sentient or purely algorithmic, and regardless of motivation; forced or
unforced assimilation into a monolithic cyborg consciousness; Michael Bay films; insanity from interacting with an
oversensitive wake word listener; physical symptoms, such as the inappropriate medication of patients mistaking distant
voice devices for hallucinations, unprompted pizza delivery, or hair loss. We aren't responsible for damages resulting
from OVOS, either, but we do not anticipate any rampant machine or human evolution in that department.
