Open Voice Community Collaboration Cabal (OVC3) Not-A-Charter

Furnished by the Confederated Consortium of the Open Voice Community Collaboration Cabal,
for the benefit of its members, the Community Collaborator Cabal Community, Community Contributors to the
Community Collaborator Cabal's code, and Co.

Drafted May 04-07 2021
Updated Oct 24 2022

Fourth Draft

Adopted [date]

Real Legalese Not Available

Be it acknowledged:

1)  That this group (henceforth 'the Cabal', 'we', or 'us') originated as an informal association of programmers,
    familiar to one another as contributors to projects, both open source and commercial, which are part of,
    derive from, or implement the Mycroft personal voice assistant. Namely, with handles familiar to
    the aforementioned Mycroft project and associated communities:

    - Aditya Mehra, KDE contributor, developer; makes things pretty, usually (handles: aix, AIIX)
    - Daniel McKnight, NeonGecko developer; makes things go upstream, if they want (handles: NeonDaniel, daniel-neon)
    - Casimiro Ferreira, omnipresent Mycroft implementer; makes things, sometimes incl. docs (handles: Jarbas, JarbasAl)
    - Chance Rosenthal, indie dev; extends things, makes happen the talky explainage (handles: ChanceNCounter, chance)
    - Peter Steenbergen, indie dev; makes things for things to run on so we can run things (handle: j1nx)

2)  That the Cabal arose organically, as an agreeable development team materialized around two major projects,
    being OpenVoiceOS, created by j1nx (henceforth 'OVOS Buildroot', formerly 'MycroftOS') and HiveMind, created
    by Jarbas, both of which significantly predate the Cabal.

3)  That, although several of the Cabal's members are also members of organizations whose products implement
    or derive from Mycroft, the Cabal is not governed or managed by any particular
    organization or group.

4)  That, the above notwithstanding, thanks and credit are due to Mycroft, BlueSystems and NeonGecko for making available
    to OpenVoiceOS a great deal of their own code, on permissive terms compatible with our licensing policy.

5)  That our licensing policy, as a matter of principle, and to facilitate the widespread and enthusiastic involvement
    of contributors whose licensing practices may differ from our own, shall be to license our open source works,
    whenever possible, under permissive licenses, placing no burdensome restrictions on how derivative works or
    implementations may utilize or redistribute our works. Examples of such licenses include, but are not necessarily
    limited to, the current (as of this writing) versions of the MIT, BSD, and Apache licenses.
    
    Specifications, documentation, and other literary works shall likewise be licensed as permissively as is practical.

    This should not be construed to mean that we will not cooperate with restrictively-licensed projects,
    though we must take pains to ensure our code is always license-compatible and compliant.

6)  That the Cabal reserves the right to replace itself with a formal, legally incorporated entity, should the
    need arise, or to replace this document with a more formal charter at our discretion.

7)  That the Cabal explicitly acknowledges its members' entitlement and, in some cases, desire, to:

      - Begin/continue to work on these or related projects in a professional capacity, or
      - Create a nonprofit foundation or business league to manage one or more of our projects, or
      - Create a company to market an implementation of one or more of our projects

    although the Cabal also notes that its founding members themselves, as of the date on this document, are not
    competing for the same business, but rather supporting each other's undertakings with an eye toward mutual success,
    whether our implementations are free or commercial, the future involvement or membership of competing, commercial
    implementations notwithstanding; and that, should the founders themselves attempt to poach each other's customers
    or business, such actions would be legal, but not very nice, considering the size of the market.

8)  When necessary, "BDFLs" for OVOS shall, for the foreseeable future, be j1nx and Jarbas, except that aix shall be responsible for all graphical elements and ovos-shell. A BDFL's authority shall be limited to the circumstances described in section (9).

9)  That the Cabal's governance shall consist of consensus-forming among its members, or, in the absence
    of a consensus, 
    
        (a) Noncontentious discussions shall be decided by the appropriate BDFL, except that any member
            may call for a vote.
        
        (b) Contentious discussions shall be decided by vote without exception.
        
        (c) In (and only in) the event of an emergency or an extremely time-sensitive problem, where an
            immediate, executive decision is required, the appropriate BDFL shall undertake the decision.

10) In the event that the Cabal's membership shrinks or grows to an even number, or a member recuses
    themselves or is absent from a vote, a tie may result. A trusted nonmember shall be designated at any given time
    whose sole responsibility with respect to the Cabal shall be to break any ties.

11) Members pledge to strive for consensus, and avoid situations in which the BDFL would need to invoke
    their rank in the first place, or where a vote is necessary.

12) Items 8-11 apply to significant changes or contentious changes. In general, adoption of contributions is encouraged and
    only requires an approving review from a code owner. Code reviews may suggest alternate implementation methods or make other
    suggestions, but non-breaking changes should be welcomed contributions.

13) The phrase "BDFL" is short for "Benevolent Dictator for Life," a term familiar to many in the fields of
    computer programming and software design, and is metaphorical. The Cabal's BDFLs, as described above, have
    extremely limited discretion in terms of unilateral decisionmaking.

14) Rules for "governance" shall not generally apply to routine tasks relating to infrastructure, repository
    management, or any other administrative duties, with respect to which a given member's permissions are a
    matter of understanding and common sense.

This document has not been shown to any attorneys because no attorney in their right mind would approve this document.
This document has not been signed because it probably isn't a legal document, and it would require travel to at least
four countries on at least two landmasses. Three, most of the time. The Cabal is not responsible for damages resulting
from the use or misuse of HiveMind, including, but not limited to, the formation of an artificial
intelligence bent on destruction, whether sentient or purely algorithmic, and regardless of motivation; forced or
unforced assimilation into a monolithic cyborg consciousness; Michael Bay films; insanity from interacting with an
oversensitive wake word listener; physical symptoms, such as the inappropriate medication of patients mistaking distant
voice devices for hallucinations, unprompted pizza delivery, or hair loss. We aren't responsible for damages resulting
from OVOS, either, but we do not anticipate any rampant machine or human evolution in that department.

Hi Mom!

@AIIX I don't agree with many of the points above ^

OpenVoiceOS being a free project, free from interference and dictatorship, is important for several reasons:

- Promotes Transparency: Having an open-source project ensures that the code and development process is transparent, which can increase trust and confidence in the project.
- Encourages Collaboration: An open-source project allows for a larger community of developers and users to contribute to the project, leading to more innovation and better results.
- Maintains User Freedom: By being free from interference, OpenVoiceOS ensures that users have the freedom to use the software as they see fit, without fear of censorship or restriction.
- Ensures Neutrality: By avoiding dictatorship, OpenVoiceOS remains neutral and avoids any particular agenda or bias that may limit its potential.

In short, keeping OpenVoiceOS free from interference and dictatorship helps ensure that it remains a transparent, collaborative, and neutral project that benefits the wider community.

I joined the project with the intention of avoiding another MycroftAI-like environment where developers are forced to conform. It's crucial that this project remains open and free, fostering inclusiveness and promoting the absence of bias.

for me personally It's essential that OpenVoiceOS remains free from the control of a single developer who decides what is or isn't useful for the project. The hallmark of an open-source project is the freedom of the code from being dominated by a single individual, ensuring that it's shaped by the contributions of a diverse community.

An open-source project thrives on community involvement at every stage. The success of an open-source project is dependent on the collective efforts of its community and the active participation of its members

# Open Voice Governance Guidelines

OVOS is a community project dedicated to building an open source voice assistant and related technologies. 
This is not a contract, charter, or legal document of any kind but is how the OVOS organization and its members strive 
to interact with each other.

1) All projects under the organization will be licensed according to our Open Source Licensing Guidelines (LINK HERE)
1) All collaborators will treat each other respectfully
1) Unless specifically noted, a repository administrator has final say over what may and may not be included in a 
   project. In the event that there are multiple administrators that are unable to reach a consensus, a simple majority
   vote among repository administrators will determine if a change is accepted or not. If a consensus still is not reached,
   an (other) OpenVoiceOS organization admin will be the tie-breaker.
    > Note that any voting should be extremely uncommon, as there should be some solution that satisfies everyone.
1) Proposed changes, roadmaps, or other short-term goals will be made public prior to adoption to allow for community 
   input and to provide adequate notice for community developers to plan around. Broad project planning will be the
   responsibility of the OpenVoiceOS organization admins; anything specific to a project/repository will be the responsibility
   of that project's admin(s). There will generally be some overlap in membership, and it is always expected that projects
   strive to maintain backwards-compatibility and maintainers collaborate on shared code/solutions.
1) Every reasonable effort will be made to accommodate users. OVOS maintainers are responsible for reviewing user issues and changes.
1) In the event that a project's sole admin is unable to continue filling that role, the departing admin may specify someone
   to take their place. If the departing admin is unable to select a new admin, an OpenVoiceOS organization admin will
   select someone.
2) In the event that a feature implementation (PR) adds functionality that is currently roadmapped but not yet started,
   every effort should be made by the contributor to meet any documented requirements and to collaborate with the project
   admin to make any changes, add tests, etc.
3) In the event that a feature implementation (PR) adds functionality that is not currently roadmapped, that project's maintainer
   should make every effort to include that feature, collaborating with the contributor to make any necessary changes for
   compatibility and future extensibility, adding tests, etc.
    > Note that it is still up to the project's maintainer to decide if a feature is valid for inclusion and the above
      guidelines all apply here.
