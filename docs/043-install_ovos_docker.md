# OVOS Docker

OVOS Docker is one of the fastest ways to get started with OVOS. However it is
a newer development and some things are not working 100% (as of August 2023,
this is the GUI). That said, if you don't need full GUI support using
ovos-docker will get you a working OVOS system in minutes.

Note: It works fine with rootless podman, despite being named ovos-docker.


Refer to the
[ovos-docker documentation](https://openvoiceos.github.io/ovos-docker/)
for information on how to use it.
