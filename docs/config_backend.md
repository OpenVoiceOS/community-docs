# OpenVoiceOS Backend Configuration
# Backend Manager

a simple UI for [ovos-personal-backend](https://github.com/OpenVoiceOS/ovos-personal-backend), utility to manage all
your devices

If you are running ovos-core without a backend OCA provides a similar local interface

![](https://github.com/OpenVoiceOS/ovos-backend-manager/raw/dev/screenshots/demo.gif)

## Install

`pip install ovos-backend-manager`

or from source

`pip install git+https://github.com/OpenVoiceOS/ovos-backend-manager`

## Usage

It needs to run on the same machine as the backend, it directly interacts with the databases and configuration files

`ovos-backend-manager` will be available in the command line after installing

## Available Backend Services

### Supported Backends

ovos-core supports multiple backends under a single unified interface

- Personal backend - [self hosted](https://github.com/OpenVoiceOS/OVOS-local-backend)
- Selene - https://api.mycroft.ai
- OpenVoiceOS API Service - https://api.openvoiceos.com
- Offline - support for setting your own api keys and query services directly

Developers do not need to worry about backend details in their applications and skills

### Identity Information

A unique uuid and pairing information generated by registering with Home is stored in:
`~/.config/mycroft/identity/identity2.json` <b><-- DO NOT SHARE THIS WITH OTHERS!</b>

This file uniquely identifies your device and should be kept safe


### STT Plugin

a companion stt plugin is available to use a backend as remote STT provider

edit your configuration to use ovos-stt-plugin-selene

```json
{
  "stt": {
    "module": "ovos-stt-plugin-selene"
  }
}
```

[source code](https://github.com/OpenVoiceOS/ovos-stt-plugin-selene)

### Offline Backend

OVOS by default runs without a backend, in this case you will need to configure api keys manually

This can be done with [OCA](https://github.com/OpenVoiceOS/ovos-config-assistant) or by editing mycroft.conf

edit your configuration to use the offline backend

```json
{
  "server": {
    "backend_type": "offline"
  }
}
```

### Selene

The official mycroft home backend is called selene, users need to create an account and pair devices with the mycroft
servers.

This backend is not considered optional by MycroftAI but is not used by OVOS unless explicitly enabled

Selene is AGPL licensed:
- [backend source code](https://github.com/MycroftAI/selene-backend)
- [frontend source code](https://github.com/MycroftAI/selene-ui)

edit your configuration to use the selene backend

```json
{
  "server": {
    "backend_type": "selene",
    "url": "https://api.mycroft.ai",
    "version": "v1",
    "update": true,
    "metrics": true,
    "sync_skill_settings": true
  }
}
```

### Personal Backend

Personal backend is a reverse engineered alternative to selene that predates it

It provides the same functionality for devices and packs some extra options

It is not intended to serve different users or thousands of devices, there are no user accounts!

This is currently the only way to run a vanilla mycroft-core device offline

edit your configuration to use your own personal backend instance

```json
{
  "server": {
    "backend_type": "personal",
    "url": "http://0.0.0.0:6712",
    "version": "v1",
    "update": true,
    "metrics": true,
    "sync_skill_settings": true
  }
}
```

### OVOS API Service

OVOS Api Service is not a full backend, it is a set of free proxy services hosted by the OVOS Team for usage in default
skills

device management functionality and user accounts do not exist, offline mode will be used for these apis

edit your configuration to use the OVOS backend

```json
{
  "server": {
    "backend_type": "ovos",
    "url": "https://api.openvoiceos.com"
  }
}
```
